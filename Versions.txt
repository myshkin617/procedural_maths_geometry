Flow of Ideas for this project
P1. Can a sphere in 3d be approximated by pathces of paraboloids?
What if I take a parabola and move its vertex in a circular path in space — what shape do I get?
Can i approximate a shape using it and what variables do i need to change for it to get as simialr as sphere”
Case 1. in a 2d plane, trying to get the same area and shape using "N" parabolas as some circle
Case 2. in a 3d plane, trying to get the approx violuem and shape using "N" parabolas of some solid sphere
##IDEA HERE : approximating using locus of some similar shapes.

P2.Approximation via Transformed Shapes
What if I now take more any general common 3d closed shapes and try to approximate it using
similar shpaes but not belonging to the same family of the target shape. 
Let the general common 3d closed shape be called "target shape"
And let the shape that will be used for approximation be called "base shape"
-> Case 1. Either one can deform targetshape such that it no longers belongs to the same family of the base shape(assuming the starting is from same base and target shape)
-> Case 2. Either one can take random any nearest shapes, purely ranodm guesses, and try to approximating by defining few varibales such as
    1. The Overlapping of the "N" base shape
    2. Only translation and scaliong is allowed, and within another subcase in Case 2, 
    let it be Case 2.a. All three translation, scaling and defomartion to tile and duplication is also allowed

P3.Optimization
-> supposing for P2.C2.a/b, if one gets such fmaily of shpaes for the task, how would one optimze it
to get the lowest ovrlap and "N" base shapes and maximium simialrity to the shape of target shape and volume.
Let E = (overlapping of base shapes) * (Number of base shapes) * (distance of base shape from the target shape only for applicable tiling shapes) * (number of transformations operatinos applied)

P4.Generalzation
-> Let us assume the "target shape" be described by some general equation of some degree, 
and also let us assume the "base shape" simialr equation is either formed by
                                            i. Random trails
                                            ii. Decompsing the target shapes equation to base shape
-> after this asumptions, let us apply E here and see how close and does this all even work out.?

Additional questions.
What families of base shapes work best? (e.g. paraboloids vs ellipsoids)
	•	Are open shapes better for both target shapes and base shapes(more flexible, less efficient)?
	•	Are closed shapes better for both target shapes and base shapes(easier to tile, but harder to deform)?
	•	What’s the role of controlled overlap (X′) in smooth approximations?

Let me start with a few fixed base and target shapes — like paraboloids → sphere, ellipsoids → torus, spheres → cube — and study those specific approximations first.”
